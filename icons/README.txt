Icon Placeholder Files

You need to add the following icon files to this directory:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These icons will be displayed:
- icon16.png: In the browser toolbar
- icon48.png: In the extensions management page
- icon128.png: During installation and in the Chrome Web Store

You can create these icons using any image editor.
Recommended: Use a simple design that represents session management or Aula.dk branding.

For now, you can use placeholder icons from online icon generators or create simple colored squares.
